## Project Overview

In this project, I aimed to practice and showcase my skills in the following areas:

- **React**: I built this project using React. It allowed me to create a responsive and interactive portfolio website.

- **Vite**: The project is scaffolded with Vite, which is a fast build tool for modern web development. It helps with quick development and provides an optimized production build.

- **TypeScript**: TypeScript is used to add static typing to the JavaScript code, making it more maintainable and preventing common runtime errors.

- **Tailwind CSS**: I utilized Tailwind CSS to style the components and layout of the portfolio.

- **Framer Motion**: is a popular animation library for React that simplifies the creation of fluid and interactive user interface animations.
